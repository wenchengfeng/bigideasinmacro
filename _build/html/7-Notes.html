<h2>1 The Modern Macroeconomic Approach and the Arrow-Debreu-McKenzie Model<a class="headerlink" href="#the-modern-macroeconomic-approach-and-the-arrow-debreu-mckenzie-model" title="永久链接至标题">¶</a></h2>
<p>\1. I recommend, as a start, McCloskey’s The Rhetoric of Economics
(1985). \2. See Ely (2010a) for an emphasis of the point that “every
good theorist assumes his</p>
<p>conclusions.”</p>
<p>\3. This general problem, of verisimilitude, may apply to other
disciplines as well;I simply do not know enough to say.</p>
<p>370 Notes to Chapter 1</p>
<p>\4. Many economists I know (including me) have had the experience at
some point intheir careers, especially at the beginning of a seminar, of
having someone say abruptly:“Yeah, that all sounds OK, but it’s all just
words, and you need to show us the facts andequations.” The age hoped
for by Keynes, when the economist would be considered asequal to the
modest dentist, can only ever happen when we all agree (as we now do)
touse mathematics to express ourselves. At the very least, we’re made
into (possiblyboring) “if-this-then-this” kinds of social scientists.</p>
<p>\5. More recently, another model’s failure to match the facts has led
to a similar cottageindustry of economists aiming to be the first to
provide a convincing resolution. This isthe so-called Shimer puzzle,
named after its creator, economist Robert Shimer of theUniversity of
Chicago. I’ll say more about the kind of model Shimer used in chapter 5.</p>
<p>\6. For more in the spirit of this section, I recommend the preface to
the textbook of DavidKreps, A Course in Microeconomic Theory (1990). It
is about ten pages long, and exceedinglywell done.</p>
<p>\7. See Caballero (2010) for a somewhat opposing view. This is a bit
rich, though. Caba-llero is an economist eminently capable of doing it
all: integrating formal models andintuitive insights in order to think
coherently about new and uncharted territory. For therest of us, it’s
better to stick to the rules.</p>
<p>\8. In chapter 5, I will return to the appropriateness of equilibrium
analysis especiallyin the context of understanding “transitional”
effects from any change in governmentpolicies.</p>
<p>\9. Interestingly, recent work by Farmer (2012) places prices as
exactly “causal” in sub-sequent real outcomes. This is done in a way
that is completely coherent.</p>
<p>\10. The interested reader is referred to “In Praise of Theory”
(Athreya 2007), a nontechni-cal exposition of the Lucas critique and its
role in spurring modern macroeconomics.</p>
<p>\11. I say “typically” because there are economists actively engaged in
studying brainfunction. See, e.g., Dickhaut, Rustichini, and Smith
(2009).</p>
<p>\12. A very well-known, now deceased, macroeconomist is reputed to have
said: “A littlebit of ‘Stokey, Lucas with Prescott’ [a colloquial name
for a standard textbook] can makeup for a lot of IQ points.”</p>
<p>\13. After all, the earth will be absorbed by the sun within 5 billion
years, so that finitedate pretty much puts a stopper on things.
Nonetheless, as I will discuss briefly inchapter 4, macroeconomists
have, since 1954, found good reasons to relax this assump-tion (in a
further illustration of the forces of practicality driving the need for
what mightinitially be seen as mathematical esoterica).</p>
<p>\14. The part of economics that deals with the specification of choice
behavior is vast.The reader is directed to the helpful nontechnical book
of Gilboa (2010) and, if stillinterested, to Kreps (1990) and the
references therein for more.</p>
<p>\15. If you look at the literature, you will see, for example, that
“hold-up” problemsarising especially in what would be infrequent
arms-length transactions, can sometimesbe dealt with by housing a range
of activities under one roof.</p>
<p>\16. Nonetheless, some goods may not actually be traded. An example is
private spacetourism: until recently, the minimum price at which
suppliers of space travel serviceswere willing to carry a tourist
exceeded the maximal willingness of any tourist. As a</p>
<p>Notes to Chapter 1 371</p>
<p>result, we saw no space tourism. Nonetheless, this does not mean the
markets for spacetravel were incomplete; it’s just that no trades of
money for travel were seen to be mutu-ally worthwhile. By contrast,
markets for certain goods and services can be incomplete ifbuyers and
sellers are unable to attain gains from trade even in the absence of any
deliber-ate impediments to trade (such as taxes or direct prohibitions).
For instance, I’d like tobuy insurance against losing my keys, and if
someone could inspect my attentivenesswhen I come home from work every
day (to ensure that I wasn’t just claiming to havelost my keys to get an
insurance payout), they might be willing to provide me suchinsurance—but
it is too burdensome to obtain such data, and as a result the gains
fromsuch transactions go unrealized.</p>
<p>Notice that I have defined private and public goods in terms of physical
characteristicsthat either completely preclude parties from being
affected by others’ consumption ofthem or fully force parties to be
affected by others’ consumption. From this perspective,a world with
“public” goods is necessarily a world where markets cannot be made
com-plete, and as we will see later, one in which the decentralized
pursuit of self-interestgenerally (and especially under linear prices)
yields wasteful outcomes. Lastly, whilepublic goods imply market
incompleteness, the converse need not hold: there can bemarket
incompleteness in a world of purely private goods. In this case, the
incomplete-ness may arise from physical constraints on the formation of
centralized markets thatthen create the need to “search” for trading
partners, or more commonly from politicalconsiderations such as outright
bans (e.g., on prostitution and drugs) or heavy taxeswhich eliminate
after-tax gains from trade, etc.</p>
<p>\17. If you like counting exercises, notice that with L goods, there
would be L2 − L rela-tive prices that one could keep track of, if one
felt like it. Why? The price of each ofthe L goods could be expressed in
terms of the rate at which it could be traded for eachof the remaining L
− 1 goods. This gives us L × (L − 1), or L2 − L prices. So in an
economywith, say 15 goods, there would be 15 × 14 = 210 relative prices.
But it’s not actuallythat bad—all you really need to know are the
relative prices of all goods, relative toany one good. With that you can
compute all the other relative prices. If there werethree goods—apples,
bananas, and pears—you don’t need all 3 × 2 = 6 relative prices.The
simplest thing to do is to express all prices relative to, say, bananas.
With this done,there are really only two relative prices to keep track
of: the price of apples in termsof bananas, and the price of pears in
terms of bananas. One can compute any of theremaining four relative
prices with this information. For example, the prices of applesand pears
in terms of bananas are 2 and 1.5, respectively, and the relative price
of applesto pears is 2/1.5, or 1.33. And the relative price of bananas
in terms of pears of 1/1.5or 0.667, and so on.</p>
<p>\18. The need to understand the strategic motivations of market
participants (most oftenthose of firms) is precisely why modern
economics adopted the formal machinery ofgame theory, especially the
branch known as noncooperative game theory. Simply put,noncooperative
game theory is what gives economists a formal understanding of whenthe
ADM model is an appropriate framework to use to make predictions for
outcomes.Chapter 2 will describe the narrow part of noncooperative
results that inform us of whenwe can apply the ADM approach.</p>
<p>\19. See Kaplow and Shavell (2002, 35–38) for a further discussion of
this point, especiallyas it pertains to the legal profession’s
interpretation of what economists mean by theterm.</p>
<p>\20. In fact, even if you forget everything else, as long as you
remember the three picturesfrom the Edgeworth box that are in this book,
you’ll know something substantive.</p>
<p>372 Notes to Chapter 22 Prices, Efficiency, and Macroeconomics</p>
<p>\1. It will become clear later in this chapter why we’d like not to
presume that partieshave more information.</p>
<p>\2. For households, this means that they can (i) sell their entire
holdings of endowmentsof commodities and shares in the firms (again, to
the clearinghouse), and (ii) then usethe proceeds to buy any combination
of goods and services they could afford at the sameset of prices. Notice
that firms’ profits at prices P would be known to households, sincethey
would be determined by prices and the supply decisions announced by
firms in theprevious step.</p>
<p>\3. If, by contrast, a household or firm felt that its decisions
constituted a meaningfulproportion of total demand or supply, and the
WCH had no way of knowing the truepreferences of the household, it would
have incentives to influence the price formationprocess. An intuitive
example is given in Mas-Colell, Whinston, and Green (1995), p.
860,example 23.B.2.</p>
<p>One could assume, for example, arbitrarily small costs of falsifying
one’s reports ofhow much one would demand and supply at various prices
just to manipulate the for-mation of Walrasian prices. In such a
setting, any market with “enough” participantswill make such behavior
not worthwhile. Roberts and Postlewaite (1976) is a landmarkanalysis of
the extent to which the incentives to misrepresent one’s demand and
supplyshrink as the economy grows “large” relative to the individual.</p>
<p>\4. If you like, you can assume that the firm owns all the equipment
and doesn’t rent itfrom others. Nothing in this story depends on one’s
interpretation here.</p>
<p>\5. Actually, when one starts listing these things, the WCH starts to
sound more likeWalMart. Also, later on, when we talk about time and
uncertainty—which seem to bemissing from this setting, but are actually
not—we’ll see that the kinds of goods andservices imagined are even
richer than you might think at this point.</p>
<p>\6. Feldman and Serrano (2006), especially chs. 2–6, covers these
ideas, and also theirlink with the “jungle” economy of Piccione and
Rubinstein (2007) that I mentioned inchapter 1.</p>
<p>\7. Robert Frank (1991) makes this point very vividly in his
undergraduate text throughan example of how, in competitive settings,
firms can be price takers but cannot remain“passive.” They must
constantly look to contain costs in the face of price changes. Hecites a
well-known change to the physical profile of trucks over time in
response torising gasoline prices. The truck manufacturers were clearly
treating high gasolineprices as given, but were then using all the
knowledge they had about how to keep costsdown in the face of these
prices. A firm that failed to implement these changes wouldhave
systematically higher costs, and since they were in a competitive
setting where theycould not charge more than their competitors for
trucking services, would earn lowerprofits.</p>
<p>\8. Stiglitz (1994) notes that this lack of commitment to withholding
reward in the faceof poor performance (by, say, shutting down plants
operating at a loss or punishingmanagerial incompetence) was important
in the failure of centrally planned societies.</p>
<p>\9. Colloquially, the topic of incentives is synonymous with asymmetric
information.When economists speak of the “theory of incentives,” they
have in mind the problem ofproviding incentives in the face of
informational and commitment-related problems.</p>
<p>Notes to Chapter 2 373</p>
<p>\10. Landsburg (2010), p. 305, contains a vivid example of how such
knowledge is impor-tant, and yet inherently inaccessible to a would-be
planner.</p>
<p>\11. This point has been famously and effectively made by Hayek (1945).
See also Lands-burg (2010), ch. 9, for a worked-out example (the whole
chapter is a tour de force inexplaining gains from trade).</p>
<p>\12. Keep in mind that by “efficient” here, I mean “technologically
efficient,” namely thatthere is no way for the industry to reshuffle
inputs across the firms within it in a waythat produces at least as much
of everything, and more of some products, without alsousing more of at
least one input.</p>
<p>\13. And all the beneficial coordination above will occur even if the
level of output issometimes marred by monopoly power—typically in the
sense that it will limit produc-tion to levels where further production
would be socially beneficial.</p>
<p>\14. The reader will find useful the perspective given in Kenneth
Arrow’s speech “LeonidHurwicz: An Appreciation,” delivered January 3,
2009, and found at
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.econ.umn.edu/news/hurwicz/arrow_on_hurwicz.pdf">http://www.econ.umn.edu/news/hurwicz/arrow_on_hurwicz.pdf</a>. See
especially the discussion onpages 3–4.</p>
<p>\15. If you know some linear algebra, read on. In infinite dimensions,
not all vector spaceshave so-called dual spaces that allow for inner
product representations of linear function-als (i.e., linear functionals
that look like vectors of prices). In this case, the notion
ofcompetitive equilibrium has less descriptive content in the sense that
the value of anygiven bundle that a household, for example, is thinking
about buying cannot automati-cally be described as “the price of each
good times the quantity in the bundle.” For thelatter to be possible,
other conditions, essentially equivalent to restrictions on the
patienceof market participants, must be imposed.</p>
<p>\16. Fans of Paul Krugman will have a field day with my blatant
advertisement forsomething beautiful, and my apparent unconcern with
“truth” (applicability). The restof the book, especially chapter 5, will
hopefully show that I and my ilk are not actuallydisconnected at all.
But pretty is pretty.</p>
<p>\17. The trucking example from the previous section is also an example
of how dispersedand specialized knowledge is brought to bear to
effectively adapt to changing conditionsin competitive economies. This
is related to macroeconomists’ view of market systems’ability to often
manage change effectively.</p>
<p>\18. In contrast, for other, usually distributional reasons, political
processes often moveto supplant market processes, even when, or
especially when, such processes reliablyconfront buyers and sellers with
Walrasian prices that all are more or less “forced” totake as given. A
famous case was the effort to control gasoline prices via direct
andcomplex limitations on prices themselves s undertaken by Presidents
Nixon and Carterin the wake of spikes in the cost of crude oil, the key
input to the production of gasoline.As for the difficulties with such an
approach, the reader is again directed to the text ofLandsburg (2010),
p. 305. His example is precisely set up to illustrate how, if the
worldworked as if there were a WCH, a change in the cost of production,
even when com-pletely unanticipated, leads to changes in the mixes of
inputs being used by each pro-ducer such that, given the new reality of
production costs in the wake of the change,there is no possible way to
reshuffle inputs across producers and obtain more of any oneproduct
without sacrificing some of another. This example highlights the likely
totalfutility of employing a well-meaning planner (intent only on
achieving such “productionefficiency”) to allocate inputs across
producers efficiently in a timely manner.</p>
<p>374 Notes to Chapter 2</p>
<p>The example is also a great one because it also highlights an incentive
problem inher-ent in eliciting the information such a planner would
need. In particular, participantswill not as a matter of course tell the
truth about the substitution possibilities they have.They will only do
so if such reports are in their interest—i.e., if they can lower their
costsor increase their profits.</p>
<p>\19. Economic theorists have also established that Walrasian equilibria
will exist in seem-ingly very “badly behaved” economies—such as ones in
which markets are incomplete,or ones in which consumers have very
peculiar (including irrational) preferences, or onesriddled by various
“distorting” taxes or other policies. In these cases, again, existence
isan especially robust outcome when the economy has a large number of
people or firms rela-tive to the number of goods being traded. This is
fortunate, since it is this setting that bothdescribes the “real world”
reasonably well and in which the assumption of price takingis likely to
be most sensible.</p>
<p>\20. For those who have some familiarity with the Lebesgue measure: the
Pareto set willgenerally be one dimension smaller than the set of all
allocations, and hence will have arelative size of zero.</p>
<p>\21. I am likely similar to many economists, who vacillate in our
opinion about the work-ability and efficiency of decentralized trade. As
the important general-equilibrium theo-rist Andreu Mas-Colell (1999) has
put it: “As with the optical illusion picture where onemoment you see
the old lady and on the next you see only the young lady, so it is
withreality: it can appear perversely dominated by externalities,
increasing returns and manyother features capable of explaining the
locking of the economy in a multitude of posi-tions, or it can look as a
majestic display of marginal adjustments pushing the economytowards one,
or a few, coherent scenarios.” I personally take the latter view far
moreoften, on balance, than the former, as will be seen in the
discussion of experimental resultson Walrasian equilibrium.</p>
<p>\22. I refer interested readers to Stiglitz (1994), and for more
formality to Kreps (1990),chs. 16, 19, and 20, and the references
therein.</p>
<p>\23. As for completeness: A storm blew over a glass-topped table in our
yard recently,scattering thousands of extremely small pieces that got
ground into the grass. A neighborpromptly informed me that many firms
stood ready to perform the complex cleanup jobfor just this sort of
situation. A classic article suggesting just how pervasive markets
are,even for goods that may seem hard to define, is Cheung (1973) on how
beekeepers andapple growers coordinated to deliver markets in what might
have seemed initially to beplaces ripe for incompleteness.</p>
<p>As for competitiveness, wait for chapter 6, where I’ll talk about the
so-called efficientmarket hypothesis.</p>
<p>\24. This is known as having “(Lebesgue) measure zero.”</p>
<p>\25. This logic just uses the negation of the implication of a premise.
The statement “Aimplies B” is logically equivalent to the statement “Not
B implies Not A.” The latter isusually called “the contrapositive.” For
example, if all Americans of Indian descent likeBon Scott–era AC/DC,
then we have the statement “Indian-American implies likes BonScott–era
AC/DC.” The contrapositive tells us that if we find a person who doesn’t
likethis music, they must not be Indian-American.</p>
<p>\26. In most models, the latter will be the set of prices facing
households and firms.</p>
<p>\27. Remarkably, this was conjectured in the late 1800s by the great
statistician and econo-mist F. Y. Edgeworth.</p>
<p>Notes to Chapter 2 375</p>
<p>\28. To supplement what follows, see, e.g., Kreps (1990), ch. 12, and
Mas-Colell,Whinston, and Green (1995), ch. 8, for detailed discussions
of the Nash concept thatprovide more precise definitions than I will
give here.</p>
<p>\29. The interested reader must read Kreps (1990). It is much deeper
(and perhaps clearertoo!) than the treatment here.</p>
<p>\30. A textbook example of such a result, for the interested reader, is
given in Mas-Colell,Whinston, and Green (1995), p. 405, exercise 12.D.2.</p>
<p>\31. The papers of Dagan, Serrano, and Volij (2000) and Serrano and
Yosha (1995), thebook-length treatment of Gale (2000), and the textbook
of Osborne and Rubinstein (1990)contain the details and references to
important landmarks in this literature.</p>
<p>\32. The work I noted earlier of Green (1980) and Green and Porter
(1984) should be keptin mind.</p>
<p>\33. The volume containing Mas-Colell’s essay, Frontiers of Research in
Economic Theory,edited by D. P. Jacobs et al., is excellent; many of the
ideas discussed therein by theleading lights of the profession have
quite inevitably found their way into this book.</p>
<p>\34. On the notion of evolutionary forces, a narrower question is
whether, holding fixeda given trading arrangement, one can explain
experimental data. This, as the recent workof Duffy and Temzelides
(2009) points out, reverses the order of things usually seen
ineconomics, but follows the rich tradition of natural science. Duffy
and Temzelides show,very roughly, that often but not always, as the
number of participants gets large, playerswho use strategies that are
“evolutionarily stable,” rather than hyperrational, trade
toapproximately Walrasian outcomes.</p>
<p>\35. Recall chapter 1, in which I described Walrasian equilibria as the
“fixed points” of aparticular mapping from prices to decisions made by
households and firms.</p>
<p>\36. I thank Doug Davis for very helpful comments on what follows.</p>
<p>\37. Similarly, experiments examining iterative price formation
procedures, such as theso-called Walrasian tatonnement mechanism, do not
do so well, particularly in terms of“who ends up with what” (see e.g.,
Bronfman et al., 1996).</p>
<p>\38. Stiglitz (1994) is apropos of this: decentralization works better
than everything else,but it may not be ADM-style reasoning of “price
taking and optimization under completemarkets” that’s behind the
“goodness.”And, we can’t yet fully say what is.</p>
<p>\39. See Stiglitz (1994) for a similar view that suggests that
producers make a great manydecisions without the use of prices, instead
using “non-price” information. One can nolonger guarantee that efficient
coordination has occurred. This, like the view in Makowskiand Ostroy
(2001), strikes me as too extreme. Few, if any, employers have the power
toset the prices of inputs as they wish. Rather, even big users of an
input, such as airlines’use of fuel, seem to be forced into taking these
prices as given. As such, their remainingdecisions must be made by
treating the price of fuel as a parameter: one they cannotcontrol, but
rather one that imposes a constraint which must be included in their
overallprofit maximization problem. To the extent that this is accurate
empirically, the airlines’actions regarding input use will be
coordinated efficiently.</p>
<p>\40. A more serious example is that of the conventional arrangements as
in banking andinsurance that one observes where, as I describe in
chapter 5, a contracting arrangementplays the role of a large number of
markets. Thus, our failure to directly “see” a hugevariety of markets in
operation does not mean that outcomes are inefficient.</p>
<p>376 Notes to Chapter 3</p>
<p>\41. And where market power is important and damaging, it might have
mostly to dowith other policies already in place, rather than with more
organically occurring formsof market power. In the context of innovation
policy, see Boldrin and Levine (2008), whoargue forcefully that US
policy may well be responsible for a particularly strong injectionof
market power into the economy.</p>
<p>\42. An exception is the class of models most often used to study
monetary policy, wheresome classes of firms are modeled as having some
market power. Still, it is a stretch tosay that the market power in
these settings is “significant.”</p>
<p>\43. I want to direct the reader to the very trenchant criticism of
Vernon Smith, in Ratio-nality in Economics (2010), regarding economists’
success thus far in effectively thinkingthrough instances of market
power.</p>
<p>\44. The reader will also find Farrell (1987) useful for an accessible
review and anotherconcrete example of how decentralized trading will not
yield a satisfactory (Pareto-optimal) outcome. That essay is also useful
for its scientific and neutral perspective onhow to interpret the Coase
theorem.</p>
<p>\45. See McMillan (1994).</p>
<p>\46. Overall, however, Stiglitz appears to hold the standard economist
view, judging fromchapter 15 of his book. Stiglitz’s book is really
about all that’s wrong with the ADM model(which is why it’s relevant to
this book), and only peripherally about what’s wrong withplanned
alternatives to “decentralized markets.” We both agree that primarily
decentral-ized approaches are the best we can do, but we differ somewhat
on why that is. Prychitko(1995) is a thoughtful review.</p>
<p>\47. This is not entirely true: recall that all the First Welfare
Theorem asks for is localnonsatiation, and that the existence of
Walrasian equilibria in “large” economies is guar-anteed by even weaker
conditions.</p>
<p>3 Macroeconomists, Efficiency, and Inequality</p>
<p>\1. As for our expertise, the distinguished economist Ariel Rubinstein
(2012) says in hisrecent book: “I had the good fortune to grow up in a
wonderful area of Jerusalem, sur-rounded by a diverse range of people:
Rabbi Meizel, the communist Sala Marcel, mywidowed Aunt Hannah, and the
intellectual Yaacovson. As far as I’m concerned, theopinion of such
people is just as authoritative for making social and economic
decisionsas the opinion of an expert using a model.”</p>
<p>One way you might interpret his statement is that economists’ “thens”
are builton so many questionable “ifs” that all other people’s “ifs”
have an equal claim on ourattention. I’m sometimes sympathetic to this
view, but I hope (and presume) that what-ever, e.g., Yaacovson’s “ifs”
were, Rubinstein would hold him to deriving “thens” in acorrect way.</p>
<p>\2. Probably the single best general discussion of these issues for the
layperson (thoughit’s dated in places) remains the exceptional book of
Okun (1974). My book covers themodels macroeconomists use and so is more
technically oriented than his, but Okun’sbook is masterful as a measured
statement from a humane economist.</p>
<p>\3. Looking ahead, chapter 5 will cover in detail some models and
results that inform uson the extent to which one can view inequality as
the visible face of inefficiency.</p>
<p>Notes to Chapter 3 377</p>
<p>\4. Typically, as I will argue below, the right metric is that of a
version of the Paretostandard known as an “ex-ante” standard, and
interestingly (conveniently?) it will allowwhat look like distributional
concerns to reenter the ambit of economists. It is also a
smallsleight-of-hand to avoid interpersonal welfare comparisons.</p>
<p>\5. See Gul and Pesendorfer (2007) for a detailed evaluation of the way
economists evalu-ate welfare. I’m certainly in favor of what they call
“Welfare I,” and I certainly do whatthey call “Welfare II,” but in
speaking with those whom I advise, I do (deliberately)wander into
Welfare III in the places where I suggest that ex-ante expected utility
undera given specification of the utility function is the “appropriate”
metric.</p>
<p>\6. Again, Arthur Okun’s (1974) book is a must-read on this point. Okun
has in mind thenarrower notion of “production-side” efficiency, though:
equalization means a drop inthe output level (or even growth rate) of an
economy. My use of the term “efficiency” isin the Pareto sense, and thus
is more demanding, in that production-side efficiency isonly one of the
requirements.</p>
<p>\7. The US has done this in places: student loans are conspicuously
nondischargeable inpersonal bankruptcy. I have done research in this
area, and while it is by no meanscompletely settled, an emerging
consensus might be that means testing may help societystrike a useful
balance between the need of some for protection against income
riskwithout making credit costs much higher for everyone else lacking
collateral (usuallyyoung, wealth-poor households).</p>
<p>\8. See section 3.I of Mas-Colell, Whinston, and Green (1995) for a
clear exposition ofindividual-level deadweight loss from non-lump-sum
taxes.</p>
<p>\9. I am clearly glossing over the myriad difficulties in talking about
“societally agreed-upon” redistribution. The Rawlsian perspective, which
we’ll discuss later, helps on thisscore, to the extent that we agree on
the level of risk tolerance to apply when judgingoutcomes.</p>
<p>\10. Taxes on corporations have negative effects because the legal
obligation to “write thegovernment a check” does not tell you how the
only parties capable of actually payingthe tax (consumers and the people
who own firms) are affected. Consumers will paythrough higher prices,
owners through lower dividends, and they will do so in amountsthat tax
law has no control over.</p>
<p>\11. Now that we have this theorem in hand, we can note that, given the
disasters gener-ated by dictatorial or centrally planned regimes, it is
a delightful happenstance thatdecentralized trading systems can, even if
only potentially, lead self-interested, ignorantparties to equitable and
efficient outcomes. “All” that is required is that we have
enoughcompetitive markets in which they can trade. Before I knew these
results, it certainly wasnot obvious to me that any system would be
capable of such performance, let alone onethat asked so little of
individuals.</p>
<p>\12. The emphasis on decentralization to deliver efficient, but
planned, outcomes isimportant. Much earlier, Hayek (1945) famously
argued that the nature of the informationneeded by a planner to arrange
for optimal outcomes was exactly what precluded plan-ning from
succeeding. Namely, he argued that the planning authority would simply
notknow what to ask, as any would-be planner would lack “the knowledge
of the particularcircumstances of time and place” (emphasis added). This
is an important point to keep inmind. Interestingly, Hayek and others
were more silent on incentival role of Walrasianprices, and how they
directly dictated rewards and costs for actions. But we see here that</p>
<p>378 Notes to Chapter 4</p>
<p>competitively determined prices might well be crucial to ensuring
judicious resource useand work effort.</p>
<p>In this sense, market socialists did not ignore the need to construct a
trading institu-tion which aggregated dispersed information, as they are
alleged to have, most famouslyin Hayek (1945). See Makowski and Ostroy
(1992). However, Hayek’s later critique (1948)did raise the issue that
the sheer number of commodities for which households havepreferences
would preclude the practical implementation of a WCH for anything but
avery abbreviated set of goods. In turn, many important commodities
might never bebrought forth.</p>
<p>\13. To revisit the welfare theorems under limited information would
take us too farafield, but the exposition in Grochulski (2009) is clear.</p>
<p>\14. Benchmark public finance textbooks are those of Myles (1995) and
Kocherlakota(2010).</p>
<p>\15. Strictly speaking, Maskin and Roberts (2008) assume strong
monotonicity of prefer-ences (that is, all consumers always like more of
all goods). This is asking more ofhousehold behavior than local
nonsatiation. But local nonsatiation alone will do.</p>
<p>\16. See Slemrod and Bakija (2008).</p>
<p>\17. The entire issue of ex-ante and ex-post efficiency is closely
related to the discussionof “fairness” as an independent basis for
policymaking, above and beyond what is pre-scribed by the criterion of
ex-ante welfare maximization. Fairness, by itself, is not a
usefulcriterion; adherence to it forces one to accept patently absurd
alternatives. The interestedreader will enjoy the book of Kaplow and
Shavell (2004).</p>
<p>\18. Another example, very casually speaking (because I have little
serious knowledgeon which to base my opinion), is the War on Drugs and
the costs of its mandatory sen-tencing, in which some families lose
primary earners and become disadvantaged relativeto others. These costs
may be so high that subsets of American society could see theirex-ante
welfare rise from a relaxation in such rules. In other words, maybe we’d
all bebetter off ex-ante in a setting where we opt for a regime with
less severe punishments(incarceration) and more narcotic abuse. It is,
of course, not crystal clear as a tradeoff,but the general idea holds.
That is, the ex-ante standard makes the most sense to applyin general,
but if one observes huge ex-post inefficiency, one ought to at least ask
aboutthe ex-ante benefits one might be getting.</p>
<p>\19. See the work of the important economist Al Roth, a leader in the
subfield of “marketdesign,” and his coauthors, who now maintain a blog
at <a class="reference external" href="http://marketdesigner.blogspot.com/">http://marketdesigner.blogspot.com/</a>.</p>
<p>\20. One of its leading architects, Narayana Kocherlakota, even happens
to be the presi-dent of a Federal Reserve Bank, a macroeconomic
policymaking position if there everwas one.</p>
<p>4 Macroeconomic Shortcuts</p>
<p>\1. The interested reader is referred to the testimony of David
Colander to the USCongress for the Hearing “The Risks of Financial
Modeling: VaR and the EconomicMeltdown” on September 10, 2009, which
contains a more extended critique known asthe “Dahlem report.” It is

<p>Notes to Chapter 4 379</p>
<p>\2. Speaking of maps, economist John Kay might disagree. See his essay
“The Map Is Notthe Territory: An Essay on the State of Economics,”
October 4, 2011, on the blog for theInstitute for New Economic Thinking,
available at
<a class="reference external" href="http://ineteconomics.org/blog/inet/john-kay-map-not-territory-essay-state-economics">http://ineteconomics.org/blog/inet/john-kay-map-not-territory-essay-state-economics</a>.
The response by Michael Woodford(available at the same website)
represents my view well.</p>
<p>\3. The reader again is directed to Weintraub (1979) for an in-depth
description of thetug-of-war between microeconomic theorists’ use of
general equilibrium to reach conclu-sions about macroeconomic phenomena,
and an earlier generation of academic macro-economists who felt that
such an approach was wrong-headed; the latter felt that startingwith
aggregated relationships, e.g., specifying the relationships between
aggregate con-sumption and aggregate income, was the only route to
progress. The latter did notprevail, and in this sense, we are all
microeconomists now.</p>
<p>\4. Some economists have also considered cases in which the economy is
not competi-tive—and bargaining of one form or another is used. But for
certain kinds of financialassets (as opposed to houses, for example), it
is very reasonable a priori, given the find-ings of the literature on
the foundations for WE, to study Walrasian outcomes.</p>
<p>\5. This has been going on for a while. Here again is Kenneth Arrow
more than sixtyyears ago: “The usual reaction of the ‘literary’ social
scientist when confronted with amathematical system designed as a model
of reality is to assert that it is ‘oversimplified,’that it does not
represent all the complexities of reality” (Arrow 1951).</p>
<p>\6. The short essay of Varian (1989) is an excellent collection of the
arguments about whytheory construction is of extra usefulness in
economics relative to some of the physicalsciences.</p>
<p>\7. For those interested, the most comprehensive treatment I have seen
on the issue ofhow mathematics became lingua franca, and also how it
influenced economics itself, isWeintraub 2002.</p>
<p>\8. The essay by Partha Dasgupta (2008) is useful here. It describes
how the tools ofmathematical reasoning seem almost preternaturally
suited to the questions of econom-ics. It presumes more mathematics than
I do here.</p>
<p>\9. See Conlisk 1996 for a detailed review of this and other issues
facing research aimedat bringing bounded rationality into practice.</p>
<p>\10. A classic reference is that of Debreu (1984): “Economic Theory in
the MathematicalMode.” See also the discussion provided here:
<a class="reference external" href="http://afinetheorem.wordpress.com/2010/06/28/economic-theory-in-the-mathematical-mode-g-debreu-1984/">http://afinetheorem.wordpress.com/2010/06/28/economic-theory-in-the-mathematical-mode-g-debreu-1984/</a>.
I agreewholeheartedly with the viewpoint therein, and would draw the
reader’s attentionspecifically to the author’s point about there being
no “universal continuity” (continuityin the mathematical sense of the
term) in the real world that assures us that “nearlycorrect assumptions
lead to nearly correct conclusions.”</p>
<p>\11. By contrast, when the brilliant but untrained mathematician
Srinivasa Ramanujanoffered the mathematical world a series of
conjectures, the profession’s response was notto accept his claims as
is, even though they were already posed in mathematical terms.Instead,
he was partnered with mathematicians who could help make these
argumentsprecise, to then decide if they were true, given their
premises. See Kanigel (1991).</p>
<p>\12. Gale (2000) is a very useful reference on this topic, as well as
for the discussion inchapter 6 on off-equilibrium-path restrictions.</p>
<p>380 Notes to Chapter 5</p>
<p>\13. You may wonder, “How can an infinite-horizon model be easier to
deal with than afinite-horizon model?” The answer is that with an
infinite horizon, every period has theproperty that the payoff, as a
function of one’s actions, one can expect to attain frombehaving
optimally from tomorrow onward never changes. This immediately
lendstractability. If this makes you curious, look up “dynamic
programming.”</p>
<p>5 Benchmark Macroeconomic Models and Policy Advice</p>
<p>\1. As should be clear by now, my aim has been to provide a purely
intuitive treatmentof how I see theoretical ideas influencing applied
macroeconomics and influencing dis-cussions by economists about
policymaking. But for inspired readers, Ljungqvist andSargent (2004)
remains the best one-stop place to get the full details, especially the
“how-to” part that I have not covered at all.</p>
<p>\2. Sir John Hicks (1939) also recognized this, in the narrower case
where he saw thesame physical good or service (e.g., gasoline or
haircuts) at different dates as distinctcommodities.</p>
<p>\3. The term “stochastic” refers to uncertainty. This logic can be
carried further: even inworlds with public goods or, more generally, in
cases where one’s actions cannot feasiblybe prevented from having direct
(as opposed to price-mediated) effects on others (so-called
externalities), one can show that through the construction of an
appropriate set ofmarkets, decentralized price-taking optimization can
still lead to efficient outcomes. Inthe jargon, this is called a Lindahl
equilibrium, and requires that a very particular set ofcommodities be
available for sale at Walrasian prices.</p>
<p>\4. Stiglitz (1994) makes this point very nicely.</p>
<p>\5. Again, by “decentralized,” I have in mind trading arrangements in
which no one“actively seeks” to improve (or damage) outcomes for anyone
else, but instead respondsonly to narrow privately relevant incentives.
Of course, these narrow incentives, such asprices, will be the outcome
of the aggregated choices of all participants.</p>
<p>\6. The interested reader is directed to Kreps (1990), ch. 6, for a
worked-out example.</p>
<p>\7. To echo again the lesson of the First Welfare Theorem, when it
comes to the bulk ofthe items we buy daily, as long as people are even
approximately sensible in their pur-chases at grocery and department
stores, there are essentially no mutually beneficialexchange
opportunities left unrealized between any of the 200,000 households in
the citywhere I live. This is true despite the fact that we hardly ever
know more than the smallestsliver of those living around us.</p>
<p>\8. For anyone else who visits, an important subset of these entities
are ones referred tocolloquially as “box stores” (pot-tee kadai in
Tamil). These are so small that only theshopkeeper can physically fit
inside. Good spot markets seem to operate outside largeIndian cities,
too. My sister-in-law has described the ease with which one can
reliablyfind (at linear prices) a huge variety of consumer goods (e.g.,
French shampoo, Americancandy bars, etc.) in even the very remote
Himalayan village she spent a year in.</p>
<p>\9. This issue gave rise to the class of SIM models I will describe
later.</p>
<p>\10. In the case of markets against the risk of being born into bad
circumstances, if weimagine each individual having only a finite life,
then we can ask to what extent marketsexist in which he or she can hedge
the uncertainty that will resolve over his or her life-time. This more
limited notion of “market completeness” is particularly useful; it has</p>
<p>Notes to Chapter 5 381</p>
<p>observable implications that help us assess the extent to which markets
fail to allowhouseholds to share risks. Of course, our own descendants
will to some extent be repre-sented by us and through the fiscal
policies we choose to put into place. We can thereforeaffect them in
ways that reflect our concern for their welfare. More on this further
below.</p>
<p>\11. Since there is so much confusion among careless observers of
macroeconomics onthis point, this is a natural place to stress yet again
the mantra “Equilibrium does notmean good”!</p>
<p>\12. This raises the general question of where “power” comes from. Nash
equilibriumsuggests that it comes primarily from somehow convincing
parties of the likely actionsof other parties. Saddam Hussein, in his
heyday, clearly could not have physically pre-vented any large-scale
revolt. The key to his success was in convincing essentiallyeveryone
else that no one would fight him. Once this was achieved, matters were
morestraightforward. In this sense, all dictators who succeed only do so
because they somehowconvince enough others that they will be successful.</p>
<p>\13. While space constraints prevent any detailed discussion, an entire
area known asglobal games aims to provide more robust prediction than
standard Nash analysis ofgames, and has studied especially those
settings in which policymakers can transmitinformation to alter outcomes
in important ways. Morris and Shin (2001) is good startingpoint, and the
recent work of Sakovics and Steiner (2012) illustrates some of the
subtleties(and opportunities) for policymakers to steer outcomes to
relatively beneficial ones.</p>
<p>\14. But events were not driven only by government policy; the college
students whoinitiated the lunch counter sit-in movement are an example
of private initiative thatstarted the change in society. These four
people played a strategy that was not Nash;given the actions of others
that they surely rationally expected, and with substantiallikelihood,
their act was potentially dangerous to their physical well-being. This
is whatmade it so courageous. And since this act led to other sit-ins
elsewhere, one might argueit was extraordinarily powerful. For some
details, see, e.g.,
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.sitinmovement.org/history/greensboro-chronology.asp">http://www.sitinmovement.org/history/greensboro-chronology.asp</a>.</p>
<p>A striking telltale sign of the role of expectations for behavior was
the policy ofWoolworth stores at the time to “abide by local custom.” Of
course, when the customdid change, so did the stores’ behavior toward
African-Americans at the lunch counter.But keep in mind that economic
theory would not have predicted this outcome at all; itwas as far from
Nash as possible to change customs in such a way. This is especially
sobecause those who initiated the movement were essentially grains of
sand on a beach,and so they would have had no rational reason to think
they could change outcomes ata societal level.</p>
<p>\15. The interested reader will find Leeper (2010) well worth reading.
It is nontechnicalfor the most part. It contrasts the extent to which
the modern descendants of the Walra-sian tradition are especially
heavily used within institutions that form monetary policy,while fiscal
policy, as practiced, is less influenced by this tradition.</p>
<p>\16. Readers who are not technically oriented and who want to read
further about theNGM, as well as an entire class of so-called endogenous
growth models, are directed tothe prescient text of Upton and Miller
(1986), and the contemporary textbook of Wil-liamson (2010). More
advanced presentations are offered in the important text of Barroand
Sala-i-Martin (1993), as well as the book of Romer (2011).</p>
<p>\17. More generally, the Malthusian conclusions follow even when more
equipment canbe added, and even when innovations routinely make labor
more productive (as washappening even before the eighteenth century).
The critical features are the presence of</p>
<p>382 Notes to Chapter 5</p>
<p>at least one input to production being completely fixed (in Malthus’s
case, this was land)and the positive dependence of the population growth
rate on the average income ofworkers. See the excellent set of lecture
notes available on Stephen Parente’s
website:<a class="reference external" href="https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/parente/Econ509/Chapter_Malthusian_Model.pdf">https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/parente/Econ509/Chapter_Malthusian_Model.pdf</a></p>
<p>\18. Easterly (2001), ch. 4, describes this effectively.</p>
<p>\19. A very useful interactive learning tool for the Solow model is
here: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.eurmacro.unisg.ch/tutor/Solowpc.html">http://www.eurmacro.unisg.ch/tutor/Solowpc.html</a></p>
<p>\20. The reader interested in more details on the Solow model, as well
as models thatdiffer from the Solow-Swan class (“endogenous growth”
models), should read the excel-lent intuitive approach taken in Ray
(1998), and then, if still interested, consult eitherAghion and Howitt
(1993), Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1993), or Acemoglu (2009).</p>
<p>\21. See, e.g., Summers (1986).</p>
<p>\22. Put slightly differently: even absent any decision to modify one’s
model to avoid themultiplicity of Walrasian equilibria, and/or any wild
fluctuations in the time path of agiven Walrasian (Radner) equilibrium,
there is still a lesson. BM and SMD are applicableto complete-market
economies in which the First Welfare Theorem holds. In other words,even
in a model where there are thousands of Walrasian (or Radner)
equilibrium out-comes, SMD and BM in no way negate the fact that every
single one of those outcomesis Pareto-optimal!</p>
<p>\23. Mas-Colell, Whinston, and Green (1995, ch. 17) is an excellent
place to go for anyonewanting to know more.</p>
<p>\24. Later on, we’ll see how the desiderata of having (at least local)
uniqueness in theWalrasian outcomes of a model, and that of working with
a model in which paths donot fluctuate in seriously counterfactual ways,
led to a strategy known as “calibration”and the class of models known
initially as “real business cycle” or RBC models.</p>
<p>\25. The interested reader can get a friendly introduction to this
topic in Mas-Colell,Whinston, and Green (1995), ch. 20.</p>
<p>\26. As Meyer and Sullivan (2009) and others have noted, all of our
conventional mea-sures of inflation substantially overstate inflation,
and thereby understate the improve-ments in well-being that we have
experienced in just the past several decades—a periodin which measured
median wages have stagnated. And once consumption is used as themeasure
of poverty, measures have shown a substantial decline in poverty over
thisperiod as well.</p>
<p>\27. I realize that long-term unemployment can be scarring. But notice
the extreme short-term cost I’ve assumed here: people have zero
opportunities for five straight years. Thus,we’ve not likely understated
the pain felt by the people concerned.</p>
<p>\28. A wide range of seemingly disparate phenomena are evaluated this
way by macro-economists because, from the perspective of the residents
of a given country, many things“look like” technological progress, even
when they are not literally technological. Forexample, by undervaluing
its currency, a country makes its products cheap. To the resi-dents of
another country that imports goods from the first country, it is just as
if someone,somewhere, discovered a cheaper way to produce. The same is
true for the tax policiesof foreign nations that favor their own
exports. Either way, domestic consumers winsince they now obtain goods
more cheaply than otherwise, while the domestic producersof competing
goods will lose.</p>
<p>Notes to Chapter 5 383</p>
<p>\29. The reader will likely find it useful to read William Easterly’s
(2001) book (also aimedat a general audience), where he makes this point
very effectively.</p>
<p>\30. The whole article is short, and very accessible. See Lucas (1990).</p>
<p>\31. An interesting exchange took place in the late 1980s between the
economistsWilliam Baumol and Edward Wolff (1986, 1988), who found direct
evidence in supportof the Solow model’s predictions for convergence
across countries; but DeLong (1988)neatly showed that Baumol and Wolff
ignored measurement error and selection biassuch that the results were
biased far too much in favor of finding convergence. Thiswas important
because it meant that, as of the 1980s, we did not yet have a
satisfactorytheory of cross-country income differences. We still have a
ways to go in this quest eventoday, and this, and its cousin “growth,”
dominate all other concerns macroeconomistsshould have.</p>
<p>\32. Arthur Okun (1975) talks about “trickle-down” in ways related to
my use of it. \33. I was led to this observation by the related idea in
Frank (1991), ch. 18, on the rise</p>
<p>in living standards over time within a country.34. See e.g., Romer
(2011).</p>
<p>\35. This is because at this growth rate, average US income in 2046
will be roughly$100,000 (in current dollars), while average European
income will be $80,000.</p>
<p>\36. A rather accessible, largely nontechnical exposition of the facts
surrounding differ-ences in hours worked is given by Rogerson (2006).
More recently, Rogerson (2009)provides a completely nontechnical
summary.</p>
<p>\37. A state-of-the-art survey on the effect of taxes on labor supply
is Keane (2011).</p>
<p>\38. As a related and completely informal observation, it seems clear
that the manner inwhich nations intervene in economic outcomes may be
crucial in determining the extentto which redistribution places them on
Hayek’s 1944 “road to serfdom.” Western Europe,which intervenes
principally via taxes and transfers, has certainly avoided such a
fate,by all accounts. In light of the individual liberties enjoyed by
its citizens, especially“negative liberties” (i.e., freedom from the
state and others in their personal lives), it is astretch to argue that
they are serfs. Nonetheless, societies that have opted for
substantialintervention in the form of licensing restrictions and
explicit control of production methodsand the scope of products consumed
or permitted to be imported and exported havebeen places where the
individual has been treated by the state as spectacularlyexpendable.</p>
<p>\39. The slides by Michele Boldrin and David K. Levine on “Full
Appropriation andIntellectual Property” (2007) are useful:
levine.sscnet.ucla.edu/papers/slides/ostroy_slides.pdf. Recall that
when I discussed Ostroy’s view of “no surplus,” I noted that itforced
one to think differently about prices. This is related to Ostroy’s
conceptionof competition allowing—or actually forcing—innovation. An
ongoing blog thatfrequently provides thoughtful assessments of models of
innovative processes (andmany others—including excellent discussions of
the financial crisis) is A Fine
Theorem,<a class="reference external" href="http://afinetheorem.wordpress.com/">http://afinetheorem.wordpress.com/</a>. (Full disclosure: I know
the anonymous authorpersonally).</p>
<p>\40. Recall Robert Frank’s trucking example that I footnoted in chapter
2 when I discussedthe “informational role of prices.”</p>
<p>384 Notes to Chapter 5</p>
<p>\41. Plosser is now an important macroeconomic policymaker: he is the
president of theFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. Recall that
another important contributor tomodern macroeconomics, Narayana
Kocherlakota, is also a Federal Reserve Bank presi-dent. It should be
apparent by now that the ideas in this book are important for
policy-making—several of the ideas originated among people who make
macroeconomic policy.</p>
<p>\42. In 1986, The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis Quarterly Review
carried an expositionof the approach I just described by Edward
Prescott. The interested reader will find itinstructive. The same issue
also contains a “reply” article by the eminent economistLawrence Summers
(former Treasury Secretary and president of Harvard University,among
other things).</p>
<p>\43. A scathing, tongue-in-cheek evaluation of Keynes’s ideas is given
by Michele Boldrinand David K. Levine in “All the Interesting Questions,
Almost All the Wrong Reasons,”online at
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.dklevine.com/papers/keynes.pdf">http://www.dklevine.com/papers/keynes.pdf</a> (last accessed February
26,2013).</p>
<p>\44. Good introductions to such models are Farmer (1999, 2010) and the
connections toKeynesian models in the important paper of Cooper and John
(1988). Some other pio-neers of adapting the SGM to settings in which
“self-fulfilling prophecies” may flourishare Costas Aziariadis, David
Cass, Jang-Ting Guo, and Karl Shell.</p>
<p>\45. One prominent example is that of Hornstein (1993).</p>
<p>\46. In my most ecumenical moods, I am tempted to say that such
reasoning applies evento the crudest versions of Keynesian economics
peddled today. And perhaps that is theright way to view it.</p>
<p>\47. See, e.g., the views expressed by John Quiggin:
<a class="reference external" href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2011/01/zombie-economics-and-just-deserts.html">http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2011/01/zombie-economics-and-just-deserts.html</a>.</p>
<p>\48. The testimony of the critics of modern macroeconomics before
Congress, which wascited in the preface, is just one example.</p>
<p>\49. Again, that these models have been standard fare in macroeconomics
for two decadesnow, while outsiders have suspected us of having only a
representative agent to dealwith, is a clear measure of the spectacular
gulf that exists between what macroeconomistsdo and what many seem to
think we do.</p>
<p>\50. Formally incorporating the search process into a household- or
firm-level decisionproblem is involved, but if you study these models
further, you’ll see that thanks to amathematical method called dynamic
programming (nothing to do with computerscience, by the way), there is a
tractable way to do it.</p>
<p>\51. A (very) technical paper that studies the question of the
existence of simple kinds ofstationary equilibrium (so-called
time-homogenous Markov equilibria, or THME) isDuffie et al. (1994).
These authors motivate the study of stationary equilibria as the
onlyones that are possibly “learnable.”</p>
<p>\52. This is mildly tautological, given the importance of unemployment
for determiningthe state of the economy!</p>
<p>\53. Diamond, Mortensen, and Pissarides are all Nobel laureates.</p>
<p>\54. The interested reader is directed to Lucas (1985) for the most
lucid account I haveseen of what the search approach buys. It is
occasionally mildly technical.</p>
<p>Notes to Chapter 5 385</p>
<p>\55. See chapter 1 in Ljungqvist and Sargent (2004).</p>
<p>\56. For the interested reader, the introduction to Magill and Quinzii
(1996) is an out-standing description of many things we have
discussed—but particularly of the modernseparation of the study of
markets into that of real versus financial ones, beginning withthe
efforts of the great Irving Fisher. It requires some technical
proficiency toward theend of the section, however.</p>
<p>\57. See Athreya and Romero (2012) for a nontechnical discussion of
economic mobility.58. Robert Aumann (1964) made this point formally a
half-century ago.</p>
<p>\59. The 2009 movie The Informant! is somewhat insightful in its
description of themechanics of setting up collusive arrangements.</p>
<p>\60. For those with familiarity with measure theory: Geanakoplos and
Polemarchakis(1986) showed that the set of economies for which Walrasian
outcomes are inefficient hasfull measure. Very recently, Davila et al.
(2012) have extended the analysis of Geanako-plos and Polemarchakis to
SIM models of the kind developed by Aiyagari (1994) andhave shown that
the size of the inefficiency may be large.</p>
<p>\61. I have this feeling from time to time. My wife and I are
comfortably positioned inthe overall US income distribution. My extended
family is close-knit and very highlyeducated. My children could be lazy,
and they could be poor students in high school,yet in neither case would
they ever feel the pinch of true deprivation. By contrast, achild with
poor cognition, born into a poor household less than 20 miles from me
indowntown Richmond, Virginia, is unlikely to escape poverty—if we take
the data onintergenerational mobility even a little seriously. This
strikes me as a risky world to beborn into.</p>
<p>\62. Recall chapter 4 where we noted the seminal work of Robert Barro
(1974), who iso-lated conditions under which a limited form of concern
for one’s descendants wouldturn the problem facing a dynasty into
exactly the problem of a single household thatlived forever.</p>
<p>\63. A metaphor may help illustrate why one ought not to expect that
decentralizedoutcomes will inexorably lead to Pareto-optimal outcomes.
Imagine a set of townsarranged along a river. Those upstream, if they
cannot trade or interact with those down-stream, may well use the river
in ways that leave it foul and polluted by the time itreaches the
latter.</p>
<p>\64. You may be appalled that I have spent nearly the entire book on a
model in whichmoney plays no role. But this is part of what showing you
the benchmark model requiresone to do. The huge amount of work in
monetary economics overwhelmingly uses vari-ants of the NGM, the SGM
models, and less often, search models. Walsh (2010, chs. 1–3)gives an
excellent exposition of monetary models based on these benchmarks,
whileChamp and Freeman (2001) uses the OG model throughout.</p>
<p>\65. In fact, he called the paper “National Debt in a Neoclassical
Growth Model.”</p>
<p>\66. The very accessible text of Obstfeld and Rogoff (1995), ch. 3, is
a great place to seeclearly worked-out examples of the OG model. The
reader will also benefit greatly fromthe wide-ranging 2005 interview
with Nobel laureate James Heckman, who is dispro-portionately
responsible for what economists know about the role of policy in skill
for-mation, racial disparity, and the intergenerational transmission of
economic status. It</p>

<p>6 Macroeconomic Theory and Recent Events</p>
<p>\1. “The Financial Crisis: A Timeline of Events and Policy Actions,”
Federal Reserve Bankof St. Louis website,
<a class="reference external" href="http://timeline.stlouisfed.org//index.cfm?p=timeline">http://timeline.stlouisfed.org//index.cfm?p=timeline</a> (accessedMarch 3,
2013). Let me stress that even the facts are not fully agreed upon (see
Lo 2012).</p>
<p>\2. And why did short-term liabilities become so attractive? Many
observers argue thatit was an easy way to obtain funding from entities
like money market mutual funds thatwere awash in available funds (see,
e.g., Brunnermeier 2009), while others have pointedto low-interest-rate
policies and international conditions (the so-called global
savingsglut).</p>
<p>\3. See, e.g., Guvenen (2012) and the references therein.</p>
<p>\4. Recall, though, that in instances where the transacting parties
have some degree ofmarket power, as well as hidden information relevant
to determining their willingnessto trade, the Myerson-Satterthwaite
theorem becomes applicable. Thus, in some cases,macroeconomists are
being optimistic when they presume bilateral efficiency.</p>
<p>\5. On consumer theory, Deaton (1991) remains the best place to start,
while for corporatefinance the easy-to-read textbook of Saunders and
Cornett (2010) will be useful.</p>
<p>\6. See Athreya, Tam, and Young (2012), Sánchez (2012), and Livshits,
MacGee, and Tertilt(2011), for analyses of better screening methods in
the case of unsecured credit markets.</p>
<p>\7. Recent work of Kasa, Walker, and Whiteman (2012), Tsyrennikov
(2012), Colacito andCroce (2012), Cogley, Sargent, and Tsyrennikov
(2012), and others illustrates progress,and clarifies some of the
significant difficulties in models where intelligent traders
havediffering views. We’ve cited Veldkamp (2011) already; it, and its
references, are obviouslyrelevant here as well.</p>
<p>\8. Gale and Hellwig (1985), Williamson (1987), and Lacker (2001) are
other importantlandmarks in the theory of debt.</p>
<p>\9. In the context of labor markets, an exception to this point is if
one really thinks thatthe uneven assignment of hours to workers is due
to some policy.</p>
<p>\10. While not a search model, the work of Lorenzoni (2008) on
externalities leading toinefficient credit booms, and the references
therein, will be useful to the interested reader.</p>
<p>\11. See the recent book of the economist John Taylor (2009), and a
detailed and probingreview of it by John Cochrane, available on his blog
“The Grumpy Economist,” June14, 2012,
<a class="reference external" href="http://johnhcochrane.blogspot.com/2012/06/taylors-first-principles.html">http://johnhcochrane.blogspot.com/2012/06/taylors-first-principles.html</a>(accessed

<p>\12. A recent speech by the president of my employer, the Federal
Reserve Bank of Rich-mond, describes two opposing views of financial
instability: inherent fragility (of theDiamond and Dybvig type) or
induced fragility (created by policymaker promises tohelp distressed
institutions). The speech is available at
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.richmondfed.org/press_room/speeches/president_jeff_lacker/2013/lacker_speech_20130212.cfm">http://www.richmondfed.org/press_room/speeches/president_jeff_lacker/2013/lacker_speech_20130212.cfm</a>.</p>
<p>\13. Let’s be concrete with another example (go back to chapter 2 if
you wish to reviewthe other ones I gave). Let’s say that the value of
maintaining a doctor’s office in a quiet</p>
<p>Notes to Chapter 6 387</p>
<p>office park was $100,000. And let’s say that the same business next door
to a confectionerwould be worth less: $60,000. Now let’s say that a
confectionery generates profits eachyear that make it worth $70,000 as a
“going concern” no matter where it is located, butto move it far away
from the city costs $30,000. The owner of both enterprises wouldthink
carefully about the costs and benefits of moving the businesses apart—it
mightraise her profits. If they were initially next door to each other,
what should she do?Leaving them in place makes the total value of both
businesses $130,000 ($60,000 +$70,000). If they were apart, they’d be
worth $170,000. Clearly, then, the owner shouldmove the confectionery:
it costs $30,000 to do so, but generates $40,000 in extra value.We can
hopefully agree that this is the efficient thing (certainly in the
narrow sensethat it makes production more valuable and, by presumption,
leaves consumersunaffected).</p>
<p>Now think of a setting in which the businesses are indeed next door to
each other,and each business is run instead by a single owner (a
crotchety doctor and a crazedchocolate factory magnate—who do not like
each other), and that these owners do notinherently share any interest
in maximizing the collective value of both businesses. Andlet’s add that
the law has taken a position on who is “liable” for compensating the
otherfor the damage caused to the other. Perhaps most naturally, let’s
say that the law requiresthe confectioner to pay the doctor $40,000 in
compensation to offset the reduction inthe doctor’s franchise. Under
these rules, what would the confectioner do? He wouldmove: it is worth
paying $30,000 (his moving cost) to save $40,000 in payments to aguy he
doesn’t like anyway. Alternatively, what if the law ignored them, asking
thedoctor to “just deal with it” by not obligating the confectioner to
make any payments atall? Would the same result ensue? It depends. If the
two parties could agree to find asolution that made the value of both
firms together as high as possible, they’d then beable to split the
gains in ways that left both better off. In this instance, the doctor
mightpay the confectioner $30,001 to get lost. The confectionery would
take the money andrun, and the doctor too would come out ahead—since the
value of his business jumpsby $9,999 (the $40,000 gain because he no
longer has any noise less the $30,001 paymenthe makes to “Wonka”).
Critically, the eventual location of each business is the same, andthe
total value of both businesses is exactly as if the same person owned
both businesses:$140,000 ($100,000 noise-free doctor’s office, $70,000
confectionery, minus $30,000 inmoving costs), with the only difference
being who has to pay for this to happen. If theycould not negotiate with
each other (perhaps because they have miscommunications andhave reached
some point of no return), then we cannot be assured of any such
outcome—and it can easily be the case that the parties miss
opportunities to make themselves bothbetter off.</p>
<p>\14. Farrell (1987) is very useful on the extent to which the
implications of Coase for policyverge on the tautological. In essence,
proponents sometimes seem to be saying: if theparties can reach an
efficient outcome, then outcomes will be efficient. To me, the issueis:
whenever the costs of communication are low, firms owned by different
parties willact like a single firm trying to maximize total value. Thus,
on the production side, I viewCoase as an extension of the
production-side aggregation result we saw in chapter 4.</p>
<p>\15. It may be obvious, but I’d like to emphasize that any doubt cast
on the ability ofpolicy to generate unambiguous improvements is not to
be taken as an endorsement oflaissez-faire, which may be disastrous by
the measure of Pareto efficiency, and yet leavefew opportunities for
well-meaning policymakers.</p>
<p>\16. Making threats credible is also at the heart of ensuring good
behavior for a nation’smonetary authority. For example, the Governor of
the Central Bank of New Zealand facesa contract in which she or he will
be punished monetarily for a failure to take tough</p>
<p>388 Notes to Chapter 6</p>
<p>actions that might, in some cases, inflict pain on the citizenry. The
citizenry, for their part,recognize that in order to take actions that
yield the best expected path for future eco-nomic activity, one might
have to commit to allowing some suffering in the future—ifonly to focus
the attention of private decision makers in the present. By setting up
thecontract with the Central Bank in this way, they ensure that the Bank
will not succumb,by its benevolence, to letting “bygones be bygones.”
For, if they were known to do so,any tough talk up front by them would
be ignored.</p>
<p>\17. For example, games where parties are not unsure about what others
have done arejust a special case of being uncertain about what others
have done. Nash equilibrium byitself has a clear weakness, though, in
that it leaves open-ended the beliefs players holdabout other players’
previous behaviors when they cannot observe them completely.Ideas like
“sequential equilibrium,” “the intuitive criterion,” and “universal
divinity”aim to deal with this shortcoming.</p>
<p>\18. According to Kreps (1990), work by McLennan (who also contributed
research onstationary equilibria in Duffie et al. 1994) started the
literature on how one might try torestrict beliefs off the path of
equilibrium play. McLennan is, by all accounts, a very“pure”
microeconomic theorist (i.e., probably not waking up to see how he can
help mytribe out), and so we’ve now seen two disparate places in which
macroeconomists areusing the tools he helped fashion. This is why it is
hard for me to see any clear distinctionbetween microeconomics and
macroeconomics aside from the scope of the questionbeing asked.</p>
<p>\19. For example, in my own research on the role of how creditors’ lack
of informationabout borrowers affects credit card lending, my coauthors
and I have modeled a gamebetween borrowers and lenders that is very
close, as a mathematical matter, to the famousso-called beer-quiche or
Spence job-market-signaling games. We then have employedPBE to select
outcomes that do not involve silly threats or beliefs. Lastly, in
relation tothe practicality of game-theoretic ideas for the
macroeconomics of policymaking, a veryinteresting aspect of games where
players move in a well-defined sequence is that whenplayers are modeled
as not knowing for sure what transpired in the game previously,one
obtains a way to model irrationality. While this topic is too far
removed from thegoals of this book, the interested reader should see
Kreps (1990, ch. 13) for a descriptionand example of this way of
modeling play against an irrational opponent.</p>
<p>\20. Notice that these problems would arise even in the absence of any
crisis-related cur-rency distortions.</p>
<p>\21. A layperson’s guide to “systemic risk” and its implications for
policy is given inAthreya (2009).</p>
<p>\22. The reader is directed again to Stiglitz (1994). Though it is not
a byproduct of therecent crisis, and so is not discussed here, it is a
high-water mark for criticism of theWalrasian (and hence,
“rational-expectations”) approach. It is also not hurried andbreathless
in its zeal to be timely.</p>
<p>As I stated earlier, though I personally think Stiglitz’s book is too
strong, and containsquantitative presumptions that one can wonder about,
it is essential reading for thosewho want a list of the dental records
for each of the bodies buried in the Walrasianfoundation for
macroeconomics. (It will also supply endless fodder for those with
calci-fied “anti-market” opinions looking to reverse-engineer support
for their prejudices, justas Hayek’s writings do for other audiences.)
Lastly, another recent offering is the well-meaning paean to
“reality-based economics” by journalist John Cassidy (2010). I’d like</p>
<p>Notes to Chapter 6 389</p>
<p>to think of my ilk as “reality-based,” and so I think it’s a bit unfair
of him to co-optthe term!</p>
<p>\23. The latest effort belongs again to Paul Krugman. In a typically
cunning move,he has penned a “Manifesto for Economic Sense” (available
at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.manifestoforeconomicsense.org/">http://www.manifestoforeconomicsense.org/</a>). While I disagree with his
scorched-earth approach,I also really want to make sense.</p>
<p>\24. This is, interestingly, similar to the nonsense that my father, a
professional mathema-tician, sometimes has to put up with when told by
fellow Indians that Vedic-era math-ematics had already made great
advances that rivaled those of modern mathematics: i.e.,essentially,
that a David Hilbert or André Weil were simply smart people
unwittinglyrediscovering a glorious past.</p>
<p>\25. Interestingly, the archenemy of many critics of modern
macroeconomics, MiltonFriedman, was fundamental in building market
incompleteness into models of house-hold consumption behavior.</p>
<p>\26. See the complaint of Colander et al. (2010).</p>
<p>\27. In turn, such a view suggests a limited and focused role for
central banks, one aimedat the objects central banks can most
effectively deal with, such as price stability, bankregulation, and
ensuring the integrity of payment systems. (In light of the crisis,
anadditional charge that may fall into the ambit of central banking is
“macro-prudential”stability. It remains to be seen whether this is a
realistic goal.)</p>
